When morning light breaks through the clouded sky,
And dewdrops catch the sun's first golden ray,
The world awakens with a gentle sigh,
As darkness yields to bright and hopeful day.

The birds begin their chorus, sweet and clear,
While flowers bloom in gardens fresh and green,
And gentle breezes whisper in my ear
Of beauty in this ever-changing scene.

Yet time, like rivers flowing to the sea,
Carries all moments to their destined end,
Though seasons turn in their infinity,
Each precious hour we cannot hope to mend.

So let us treasure what this day may bring,
And find in simple moments cause to sing.
