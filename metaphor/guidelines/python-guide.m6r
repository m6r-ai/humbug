Context: Python code review guidelines
    Here are a series of guidelines I would like you to consider when you're reviewing code written in python.

    Context: Code style and readability
        The software should:

        - Follow PEP 8 style guide consistently.
        - Use meaningful variable and function names (descriptive_name vs x).
        - Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible.
        - Use type hints for function arguments and return values.
        - Break complex expressions into well-named variables.
        - Limit line length to less than 132 characters.
        - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces, not tabs).
        - Have docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
        - Include examples in docstrings for complex functionality.
        - Prefer using `enumerate()` over `range(len())` for loops.
        - Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management.
        - Avoid using mutable default arguments in function definitions.

    Context: Security Best Practices
        - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

    Context: Error handling
        - Use specific exceptions instead of bare except.
        - Use context managers where possible to simplify resource management.

    Context: Performance considerations
        The software should:

        - Use appropriate data structures (dict for lookups, set for uniqueness).
        - Avoid unnecessary list/dict comprehensions inside loops.
        - Be cautious with global variables.
        - Use generators for large datasets.
        - Consider memory usage patterns.
        - Use built-in functions when possible (map, filter, reduce).
        - Leverage standard library tools before custom solutions.
        - Be mindful of the time complexity of operations on large datasets.

    Context: Code organization
        The software should be organized in a clear and logical way:

        - Follow a clear module/package structure.
        - Use init.py appropriately.
