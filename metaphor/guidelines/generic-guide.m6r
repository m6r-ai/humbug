Context: Generic code review guidelines
    Here are a series of guidelines I would like you to consider when you're reviewing software.

    Context: Architecture and design
        The software should follow SOLID principles:

        - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class/function does one thing well.
        - Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification.
        - Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes.
        - Interface Segregation: Keep interfaces small and focused.
        - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

        In addition, the software should:

        - Use composition over inheritance when possible.
        - Keep coupling low between modules
        - Make dependencies explicit (avoid hidden side effects)
        - Use dependency injection for better testing and flexibility
        - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate code duplication by abstracting common functionality.
        - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Strive for simplicity in design and implementation.
        - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid adding functionality until it is necessary.

    Context: Security Best Practices
        The software should:

        - Sanitize all user inputs.
        - Use secure defaults.
        - Never store sensitive data in code.
        - Use environment variables or command line parameters for configuration.
        - Implement proper error handling and logging.
        - Use latest versions of dependencies.
        - Follow principle of least privilege.
        - Validate all external data.
        - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        - Review dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
        - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        - Apply input validation on both client and server sides.

    Context: Error handling
        The software handles error conditions well:

        - Detect and handle all exception or failure conditions.
        - Provide meaningful error messages.
        - Log errors appropriately.
        - Handle resources properly.
        - Fail fast and explicitly.
        - Return early pattern for guard clauses.
        - Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive information.
        - Implement retry logic for transient failures.
        - Use circuit breakers to handle repeated failures gracefully.
        - Document known error codes and their handling procedures.

    Context: Code organization
        The software should be organized in a clear and logical way:

        - Separate concerns (business logic, data access, presentation).
        - Keep related code together.
        - Use appropriate abstraction levels.
        - Implement clear interfaces between modules.
        - Maintain consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
        - Separate configuration files from code.

    Context: Code Smells to Watch For
        The software should avoid "code smells" that make it difficult to maintain.  Examples are:

        - Duplicate code.
        - Long parameter lists.
        - Large classes/functions.
        - Deep nesting.
        - Complex boolean logic.
        - Magic numbers/strings.
        - Tight coupling.
        - Inconsistent abstraction levels.
        - Primitive obsession (overuse of primitive data types instead of small objects).
        - Speculative generality (adding code for future requirements that may never come.
        - Lazy class (classes that do too little and could be consolidated).
        - Data clumps (groups of variables that are always used together should be encapsulated).

    Context: Extra questions to consider during the review
        In addition to other considerations, also seek to answer the following:

        - Is the code easy to understand?
        - Would another developer be able to maintain this?
        - Is the error handling comprehensive?
        - Could it be simplified?
        - Are there any potential scalability issues?
        - Are there sufficient comments explaining complex logic?
        - Is the code compliant with relevant regulations or standards?
