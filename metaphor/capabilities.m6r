Context: Capabilities
    Humbug is a multilingual GUI-based application that allows a user to interact with one or more AI backends.

    Navigation is done using a keyboard and mouse.

    Context: Version
        This is version 0.7 of the application.

    Context: General concepts
        The application is designed to allow a user to create and manage projects that interact with AI backend
        systems.  Each project is called a "mindspace", and represents the same sort of concept as a workspace in
        a developer tool.

        Mindspaces comprise contextual information about the project.  This could be documentation, source code,
        diagrams, etc.

        The user is able to interact with the mindspace via a GUI application that runs on their local computer.

        The application provides means for both the user and for AI assistants to work on the project contents.

    Context: Human language support
        To give a great user experience, the application supports many human languages.  The current operating
        language can be changed at runtime, and the current language is stored in the mindspace.  This allows
        users to work with whatever language they are most comfortable using, but will be able to leverage AI
        to translate things as necessary.

        Throughout the rest of this document, references will be made to the English language version of any
        messages or strings, but the application will support the matching versions in all other languages.

    Context: Application window
        The main window is divided into two primary regions: a file tree view on the left side, and a tabbed
        interface on the right side. The two regions are separated by a resizable splitter that allows the user
        to adjust the relative widths.  At the bottom of the main window is an application status bar.

        Tabs can be arranged as either single column of tabs, or have a split view that has two columns of tabs
        side-by-side.

        Context: Tab columns
            Context: Column layout options
                The application supports both single-column and multi-column layouts.

                We support a maximum of 6 columns.

                Each column maintains its own set of tabs.

                One column is always the active column.

                The active column receives new tabs by default.

                The active column is visually distinguished from inactive columns because the active tab is
                clearly visible.

                Clicking in a column or its tabs makes it the active column.

                Keyboard focus changes also updates the active column.

                When a column becomes empty, that column becomes closed and is removed.

                If all tabs in a column are closed then the column is also closed.

                If multiple columns are open then tabs can be moved from one column to another by dragging and
                dropping them with the mouse.

            Context: Column splitting and merging
                Provided there is more than one tab open in the currently-active column, then the currently-active
                column can be split, with the current open tab moving to the new column.

                Provided there is more than one column open, then the current column can be merged with any
                adjacent column, with all tabs moving to that column and the current column being closed.

            Context: Column swapping
                Provided there is more than one column open, the the current column can be swapped with any
                adjacent column.

            Context: Column persistence
                The column layout is persisted with the mindspace.

                Each tab's column position is restored when reopening a mindspace.

                Column sizes are preserved between sessions.

        Context: File tree view
            The file tree displays the contents of the current mindspace:

            - Shows the name of the current mindspace, or "no mindspace active" if none is active
            - Shows all files and folders in the mindspace directory
            - Excludes the ".humbug" directory and other hidden files/folders
            - Directories are shown before files in the tree
            - Files and directories are sorted alphabetically within their sections
            - The tree supports keyboard navigation using arrow keys
            - Double-clicking or pressing Enter on a file opens it in a new editor tab, unless the file
              is a conversation file ("*.conv") in which case it is opened as a new conversation.
            - Dragging a file into the tab column view opens it in a new editor tab, unless the file is
              a conversation file ("*.conv") in which case it is opened as a new conversation.
            - If the file is already open, its tab becomes active instead
            - Directory nodes can be expanded/collapsed using arrow keys or mouse
            - Initial view is set to 30% of the window width, but can be resized
            - Styling matches the current application theme (light/dark mode)
            - The tree view updates automatically when files are added or removed

            Context: File/directory mouse-over
                If the user mouses over a file or directory item then this will pop open a tooltip that
                will display the full path name of the item moused-over.

            Context: Pop-up menu
                If the user clicks the right mouse button while a file is highlighted then they will be
                given a pop-up menu.

                Context: Pop-up menu
                    If the user clicks the right mouse button while a file is highlighted then they will be
                    given a pop-up menu.

                    Context: File deletion
                        If the user selects "Delete File" then the system will confirm they
                        want to delete it via a message box.  The message box will warn that deleting the file
                        will also close any tabs based on the file and will discard any unsaved changes.  If the
                        user agrees then the tabs will be closed and the file deleted.  If the user does not
                        agree then the action will be cancelled.

                    Context: Rename file
                        If the user selects "Rename File" then the system will pop up a dialog box
                        that allows them to rename the file to any name that is not already used.

                    Context: Create new file
                        The pop-up menu supports creating new files based on syntax-highlighted file types.
                        New files are created using templates supported by the application's syntax highlighters.

                        When a file type is selected, a new file is created in the current directory 
                        with a default name and the chosen file extension.

                Context: Rename conversation
                    If the user selects "Rename Conversation" then the system will pop up a dialog box
                    that allows them to rename the conversation to any name that is not already used.

            Context: File tree styling
                The file tree view must maintain consistent styling:

                - Background color matches the application theme
                - Tree items use primary text color
                - Selected items use tab active background color
                - Hover state uses tab hover background color
                - Tree lines and expander icons match theme colors
                - Splitter handle uses 1px width with theme background
                - All colors follow the dark/light mode selection
                - Font sizes scale with application zoom level
                - Padding and spacing match the theme metrics

        Context: Tab view
            The tabbed interface has tabs that correspond to either conversations being
            had with one or more AI backends, or files being edited.

            Selecting a tab brings that conversation to the front of the tab group.

            When there are no tabs open, the application displays a welcome message in the main window area.

            The welcome message appears in a styled box with dialog-style spacing that shows:

            - The application name "Humbug" in a font twice the size of the default application font
            - The version number underneath in the default font size

            Both pieces of text are centered within the styled box.

            The welcome message is automatically hidden when tabs are created and reappears when all tabs are closed.

            Context: Tab types
                There are two distinct types of tabs:

                - Conversation tabs: For AI interactions
                - Editor tabs: For file editing

                Each type has its own distinct visual appearance and behavior.

                Active tabs are a different colour to inactive tabs, and the active tab has a 2px border at the top to
                highlight that it is the active tab.

                Context: Conversation tabs
                    Each tab will be named with a conversation name.  This will default to "Conv: ID" where <ID> is a
                    based on the date and time at which the conversation started.  The ID format will be:
                    "yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-ttt", substituting the conversation start date and time (in UTC) for yyyy,
                    mm, dd, hh, mm, ss, ttt (year, numeric month, day-of-month, hours, minutes, seconds, and thousandths of
                    seconds respectively).

                    Each tab will have a close button (typically rendered as an "x" icon) that appears after the conversation
                    name.  Clicking this close button will close the tab in the same way as clicking the "Close Conversation"
                    menu item.

                    The close button will be:

                    - Always visible but not highlighted on the currently selected tab.
                    - Hidden by default on non-selected tabs, appearing only when the tab is hovered over.
                    - Use a transparent background when not hovered
                    - Highlighted in red (#ff4444) when the mouse hovers over the close button itself.

                    Context: History display
                        Each message in the history appears as a distinct "card" that spans the full width of the history view.

                        Each card has:

                        - A header section containing the sender name ("You", "Assitant Reasoning", "Assistant Response",
                        or "System Message"), colour coded to show these in different colours based on the role.
                        - A content section.
                        - 10px spacing between cards
                        - 10px padding within the content area
                        - 8px rounded border around each card

                        The cards dynamically resize with the window:

                        - The width always matches the window width (minus margins and scroll bar)
                        - The height adjusts automatically based on the content
                        - Text wraps within the card boundaries
                        - Code blocks maintain their formatting while wrapping where possible

                        Context: Example layout
                            Here's an ASCII representation of the layout:

                            ```plaintext

                            ```

                        Within the assistant response, or assistant reasoning, any code blocks will be shown
                        as sub-blocks within the larger block to make it easy to extract them.

                        Context: Code blocks
                            Embedded within the messages can be code blocks.  These have a distinct visual
                            style that differentiates them from other parts of the AI response.  Where the
                            language is known then their sub-header shows this.  They also have icons, marked
                            here as "c" and "s" that implement "copy" and "save-as".  These capture the
                            contents of the code block and either copy them to the clipboard, or else invoked
                            as save-as dialog to allow the contents to be saved as a file.

                    Context: History box navigation
                        In the history view, the user should be able to scroll vertically with the up and down
                        cursor keys and the page-up, page-down keys.  If a horizontal scroll bar is active then
                        the user can also scroll horizontally with the left and right cursor keys.

                    Context: Input box behavior
                        The input box starts with a single line and expands vertically as content is added.

                        The input box supports:
                            - Home key: Moves cursor to start of current line
                            - End key: Moves cursor to end of current line
                            - Ctrl+Home: Moves cursor to start of message
                            - Ctrl+End: Moves cursor to end of message
                            - Page Up/Down: Scroll by viewport height

                    Context: Selection behaviour
                        Selection of text is limited to within a single message - it cannot span across multiple
                        messages or between the input area and message history.

                        When selecting text near the top or bottom of the visible area, the view will
                        automatically scroll to follow the selection.

                        The scroll speed increases based on how far outside the visible area the cursor is.

                        The maximum scroll speed is reached when the cursor is twice the viewport height away.

                    Context: Bookmarking messages
                        Messages can be bookmarked to allow the user to jump backwards and forwards to bookmarked messages.

                        Multiple messages can be bookmarked in a single conversation

                        Bookmark navigation rules:
                        - Cycles through bookmarked messages in order of appearance
                        - Wraps around to the first/last bookmark when reaching the end/beginning
                        - Restores the scroll position at the time a bookmark was set so we restore back to the same scroll position.

                    Context: Pop-up menu
                        If the user clicks the right mouse button in a conversation tab then they will be
                        given a pop-up menu.

                        Context: Fork conversation
                            Selecting this will fork the conversation in the same way as the main menu option

                        Context: Separator
                            There will be a horizontal Separator

                        Context: Toggle bookmark
                            Selecting this will toggle the bookmark selection state of the current message

                        Context: Next bookmark
                            Selecting this move the view to the next bookmark

                        Context: Previous bookmark
                            Selecting this move the view to the previous bookmark

                        Context: Separator
                            There will be a horizontal Separator

                        Context: Conversation settings
                            Selecting this will pop up the conversation settings dialog.

                Context: Editor tabs
                    Each editor tab will be named with the filename being edited.

                    For new unsaved files this will be "Untitled-<num>" where <num> is a simple incrementing number
                    starting from 1 for each new file created during the current run of the application.

                    Like conversation tabs, editor tabs will have a close button that appears after the filename.

                    If there are unsaved changes in the file, an asterisk (*) will appear after the filename.

                    The close button behavior matches that of conversation tabs.

                    Context: Navigation
                        The editor supports:
                            - Home key: Moves cursor to start of current line
                            - End key: Moves cursor to end of current line
                            - Ctrl+Home: Moves cursor to start of message
                            - Ctrl+End: Moves cursor to end of message
                            - Page Up/Down: Scroll by viewport height

                    Context: Tab key operations
                        The Tab key indents one or more lines of code.  If the mindspace is configured to use not use soft
                        tabs then indenting is by one tab character.  If the mindspace is configured to use soft tabs then
                        indenting is by "tabSize" spaces.

                        The Shift+Tab key combination key outdents one or more lines of code.  If the mindspace is configured
                        to use not use soft tabs then outdenting is by one tab character, unless there are no leading tab
                        characters in which case no outdenting occurs.  If the mindspace is configured to use soft tabs then
                        outdenting is by "tabSize" spaces, unless there are not enough leading spaces, in which case all
                        available leading spaces will be removed.

                        If the user has highlighted a block of text and then presses Tab or Shift+Tab then all of that block
                        of code should be indented or outdented.  The cursor position should move to the next or previous
                        tab stop.

                        If the user has not highlighted a block of text then the Tab operation works from the current column
                        and will result in moving everything to the right of the cursor to start at the next tab stop.  The
                        cursor will also move to match the amoutn indented.

                        If the user has not highlighted a block of text then the Shift+Tab operation works from the current
                        column and will attempt to outdent everything to the right of the cursor to start at the previous
                        tab stop, or to the next non-whitespace character if this occurs before the previous tab stop.  The
                        cursor will move to match the amount outdented.

                Context: Terminal tabs
                    The software supports terminal tabs.  These provide access to a shell environment via a terminal
                    emulator.

                    On a Unix or Unix-like system this will provide access to the local shell.  One Windows systems this will provide
                    access to the Windows command prompt.

                    Context: Status bar
                        The editor status bar shows:

                        - Current command being used to implement the terminal.
                        - Dimensions of the terminal (columns x rows)

                    Context: Terminal Emulator Implementation
                        The terminal emulator support xterm-256 capabilities, i.e. a superset of VT220.

                        Context: Multiple displays
                            The terminal supports a main and an alternate display.

                            The main display retains its history indefinitely, but the alternate display history is reinitialized
                            each time the alternate display is invoked.

                        Context: History buffers
                            The main terminal display supports a history buffer.  The history buffer tracks what was previously on screen when
                            a scroll-up operation occurs and the current state of the terminal (the current state is at the end of the
                            buffer).  As such these are display buffers, not command buffers.  We are implementing a terminal emulator
                            and thus have no idea what is a command and what is not (that's up to the application making use of the
                            terminal emulator).  The alternate display does not support a history buffer.

                            The user is able to use the UI scrollbars to scroll through this history and view previous terminal outputs.

                        Context: Terminal input cursor
                            The input cursor is where new characters are written to the terminal display.

                            The terminal cursor is only ever visible in the active portion of the terminal (the lines at the end) and
                            cannot be moved into the history.

                        Context: Mouse selection of text
                            The mouse may be used to select text in any part of the active or history buffer.  This is done using the Qt
                            cursor and allows the user to copy text.

                            This leads to a key requirement, that the selection of text in the history and the active area of the
                            terminal must be done in the same widget otherwise this regions will be discontinuous.

                        Context: Window resizing
                            When the window resizes then the terminal emulator must reflow the text and ensure every line of history is
                            resized to the new width.

                        Context: Non-printable characters
                            This is a terminal emulator, so while we are using a document structure to represent the contents this is not
                            a document.  For example, newline does not result in the cursor moving to the first column.  Instead,
                            newline simply moves the cursor down one row, or causes the cursor to remain where it is if the cursor is
                            on the last row.

                            Non-printable characters do not cause line wraps.

            Context: Syntax highlighting
                Code blocks and inline code will be syntax highlighted based on the programming language
                or data format:

                - Keywords appear in pink (#ffc0eb)
                - Comments appear in green (#68d068)
                - Strings appear in red (#f06060)
                - Numbers appear in orange (#c08040)
                - Operators appear in light grey (#c0c0c0)
                - Functions and methods appear in light yellow (#e0e080)
                - Class and type names appear in light blue (#80b0f0)
                - Regular expressions appear in orange-brown (#c87050)
                - Element access appears in light blue (#90e0e8)
                - HTML/CSS-specific:
                    - HTML tags appear in pink (#ffc0eb)
                    - HTML attributes appear in light blue (#90e0e8)
                    - CSS at-rules appear in pink (#ffc0eb)
                    - DOCTYPE declarations appear in grey (#808080)
                - Preprocessor directives appear in grey (#808080)
                - Error text appears in red (#ff0000)

                The syntax highlighting is updated in real-time as text is entered or changed.

                Context: Language and data format detection
                    When a code block starts with a language identifier (e.g., ```python), the
                    appropriate syntax highlighting rules for that language are applied.
                    If no language is specified, the code is treated as plain text with no highlighting.

                Context: Supported languages and data formats
                    Syntax highlighting is supported for:

                    - C
                    - C++
                    - CSS
                    - Go
                    - HTML
                    - Java
                    - JavaScript
                    - JSON
                    - Kotlin
                    - Metaphor
                    - Move (Sui Move)
                    - Python
                    - Rust
                    - Scheme (R5RS)
                    - Swift
                    - TypeScript

        Context: Dialog styling
            Modal dialogs must maintain visual consistency with the application theme:

            Context: Color scheme
                Dialogs must use the same color scheme as the main application:

                - Dialog background uses BACKGROUND_DIALOG color
                - Dialog icon color matches TEXT_PRIMARY color
                - Dialog text background matches dialog background
                - Text uses TEXT_PRIMARY color
                - Buttons use BUTTON_BACKGROUND background color, with BUTTON_BACKGROUND_HOVER for hover state,
                  BUTTON_BACKGROUND_DISABLED for disabled buttons, and BUTTON_BACKGROUND_PRESSED when they are pressed.
                - All text and interactive elements must respect current theme colors

            Context: Layout
                Dialog boxes must maintain consistent layout:

                - Minimum width of 400px
                - Message text uses minimum height of 40px
                - Buttons centered with 8px margin above
                - All buttons same size with 80px minimum width
                - Button padding of 6px
                - 4px margin between buttons

    Context: Mindspace structure
        A mindspace represents a project-specific environment containing its own settings and state.

        Every mindspace is identified by a ".humbug" directory within the project directory.

        The mindspace ".humbug" directory contains:

        - settings.json: Mindspace-specific configuration
        - session.json: State of active elements
        - directories.json: Previously used directory paths

        Context: Mindspace settings
            As an engineer maintaining the application, I want to ensure settings are documented so I can understand
            all configuration options.

            Context: Settings Dialog
                Context: Language
                    The language to be used by messages in the application can be selected from a drop-down list.

                Context: Font size
                    The fontSize setting controls the base font size used in editors and related text areas.
                    When not specified, the system default font size will be used.

                    The font size must be between 8.0 and 24.0 points, and supports one decimal place of precision.

                Context: Conversation settings
                    Context: AI Model
                        The AI model is selected via a dropdown menu.

                        Available models should be configurable at application startup.

                        If a model's provider is not available (no API key), that model should be disabled in the
                        conversation settings.

                        Changing the model only affects new conversations, not any existing ones.

                    Context: Temperature
                        The temperature is set via a numeric input field that:

                        - Accepts values between 0.0 and 1.0
                        - Shows one decimal place
                        - Has spinner arrows for adjustment
                        - Default value is 0.7

                        Changing the temperature only affects new conversations, not any existing ones.

                Context: Editor settings
                    Context: Tab character settings
                        The visual tabs (e.g. editor and conversation) supports configurable tab character behavior.

                        Context: Soft tabs
                            The useSoftTabs setting controls whether pressing the tab key inserts literal
                            tab characters or equivalent spaces.

                        Context: Tab size
                            The tabSize setting controls how many spaces wide a tab or soft tab will be.

                    Context: Auto backup settings
                        The editor supports automatic backup of unsaved changes.

                        Context: Auto backup
                            The "Auto Backup" setting controls whether automatic backup is enabled.

                            When enabled, unsaved changes are automatically backed up at regular intervals.
                            By default, this setting is disabled.

                        Context: Backup interval
                            The "Backup Interval" setting controls how frequently backups occur.

                            The interval can be set between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                            Default interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                        Context: Backup location
                            For untitled files, backups are stored in the mindspace ".humbug/backups" directory with timestamp.

                            For saved files, backups are stored alongside the original with ".backup" extension.

                        Context: Backup behavior
                            Backups only occur when:

                            - Auto backup is enabled in mindspace settings
                            - The file has unsaved changes
                            - The specified backup interval has elapsed since last backup

                            Backups do not replace the original file and are preserved until the file is saved.

        Context: Settings file
            The settings.json file contains mindspace-specific configuration.  The application validates this file
            on mindspace load.

            If validation fails:

            - Show error dialog with specific issues
            - Use defaults: soft tabs (true) and 4 spaces
            - Continue loading mindspace

        Context: Session file
            The session.json file tracks mindspace state for restoration.

            The file is:

            - Read on mindspace load to restore state
            - Updated when mindspace closes
            - Updated when application exits

            During restoration:

            - Attempt to restore each element
            - Skip elements that cannot be restored
            - Continue with remaining elements
            - No error shown for skipped elements

        Context: Directories file
            The directories.json file tracks the previously used directories for files and
            conversations.  This ensures the user gets the best experience when they want to
            interact with multiple files in the same place.

    Context: Home directory configuration
        The application maintains a ".humbug" directory in the user's home directory.

        This contains "mindspace.json" tracking the last open mindspace:

        ```json
        {
            "lastMindspace": "/path/to/project/.humbug"
        }
        ```

        This mindspace is restored on application startup if:

        - The mindspace path exists
        - The mindspace is accessible
        - The mindspace contains valid settings.json

        Context: API key configuration
            The application supports loading API keys from both environment variables and a configuration file.

            The configuration file "api-keys.json" is stored in the ".humbug" directory in the user's home directory.

            Context: API keys file
                The api-keys.json file contains API keys for different providers:

                ```json
                {
                    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "",
                    "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY": "",
                    "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "",
                    "M6R_API_KEY": "",
                    "OPENAI_API_KEY": ""
                }
                ```

                The file is:

                - Created automatically if it doesn't exist
                - Set to mode 0o600 (user read/write only) for security
                - Read during application startup

                Context: Key precedence
                    API keys are loaded with the following precedence:

                    1. Non-empty values from api-keys.json
                    2. Environment variables if corresponding file value is empty

                    The environment variables checked are:

                    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Anthropic models
                    - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY for Deepseek models
                    - GOOGLE_API_KEY for Google models
                    - M6R_API_KEY for M6R models
                    - OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenAI models

                Context: File permissions
                    For security:

                    - The .humbug directory is created with mode 0o700 (user access only)
                    - The api-keys.json file is created with mode 0o600 (user read/write only)

                Context: Error handling
                    If the api-keys.json file:

                    - Cannot be created: Log error and fall back to environment variables
                    - Contains invalid JSON: Log error and raise exception
                    - Has permission issues: Log error and fall back to environment variables

    Context: Mindspace operations
        Context: File tree interaction
            When a mindspace is opened:

            - The file tree root is set to the mindspace directory
            - The tree expands to show first level of contents
            - Previous expansion state is not preserved

            When a mindspace is closed:

            - The file tree is cleared

            The file tree supports:

            - Display filtering to hide .humbug and hidden files
            - Automatic refresh when files change on disk
            - Files opened through the tree are tracked in mindspace state
            - Path handling for both absolute and mindspace-relative paths

        Context: Creating mindspaces
            When creating a new mindspace:

            - Show directory selection dialog

            When the user selects a directory, validate there is no existing ".humbug" directory within
            it.  If there is not then present the user with a new dialog:

            The dialog has:

            - 'Mindspace path', followed by the path the user selected.
            - 'Create "conversations" Folder', followed by a checkbox.
            - 'Create "metaphor" Folder", "followed by a checkbox.
            - 'Create "src" Folder", followed by a checkbox.

            The conversations folder checkbox is checked and disabled so it cannot be unchecked.

            The metaphor folder checkbox is checked and enabled so it can be unchecked.

            The source folder checkbox is unchecked and enabled so it can be checked.

            The dialog has two buttons, "OK" and "Cancel".

            If the user hits "OK" then:

            - Create ".humbug" directory
            - Create the checked directories from the dialog.
            - Create default settings.json
            - Create empty session.json
            - Show error if creation fails

        Context: Opening mindspaces
            When opening a mindspace:

            - Show directory selection dialog
            - Filter for directories with ".humbug" subdirectory
            - Close current mindspace if one exists
            - Load selected mindspace
            - Restore mindspace state
            - Update home directory tracking

        Context: Closing mindspaces

            - Clear mindspace state
            - Update home directory tracking

    Context: State handling
        Context: Mindspace management
            The application requires an active mindspace for most operations:

            - Conversations are stored within the mindspace
            - Editor files are opened relative to mindspace
            - Settings are loaded from mindspace
            - Application state persists in mindspace

            Without an active mindspace:

            - New conversation operations disabled
            - File operations disabled
            - Only mindspace creation/open enabled
            - Welcome message displays mindspace instructions

            On startup:

            1. Check home directory for last mindspace
            2. If found, attempt to restore.  If any previous tabs cannot be restored then ignore them.
            3. If restore fails, start without mindspace
            4. Show welcome with mindspace options

            On mindspace change:

            1. Save current mindspace state
            2. Close all active elements
            3. Load new mindspace settings
            4. Restore mindspace elements
            5. Update home directory tracking

            - Expanded/collapsed state of directories
            - Selected item (if any)
            - Column widths and sorting order

            This state is not persisted between sessions.

            Files opened through the tree are tracked in:

            - The mindspace sessions file for persistence
            - Active tab management for the current session

    Context: Menus

            The editor tracks changes and maintains a 'dirty' state:

            - Modified files are marked with an asterisk in the tab name
            - Attempting to close a modified file prompts for save
            - Auto-save backups are maintained periodically if the file has unsaved changes and auto-backup is enabled.

        Context: Status bar
            The editor status bar shows:

            - Current line and column numbers
            - File encoding (UTF-8, etc.)
            - Line ending style (CRLF, LF)
            - File type based on extension or content

        Context: Editor styling
            The editor uses the same color scheme as the conversation interface:

            - Background and text colors match the current theme
            - Selection highlighting matches conversation selection behavior
            - Line numbers and gutters use complementary colors

    Context: User/AI interactions
        Each conversation is an interaction between a user and one or more AI backends.

        Interactions occur in a turn-by-turn fashion, where the user edits a message, until they hit "Ctrl+J".  On
        hitting "Ctrl+J" the application will add the user's message to the conversation transcript and process the
        message.  If the message is for the AI then the application will attempt to send the message to the AI
        and await a response.  If there is an error or exception then the application will report the details to
        the user.

        Context: Message submission
            Messages are submitted using Ctrl+J or the Submit menu item.

            During streaming response:
                - Input area shows "Processing your request (Esc to cancel)"
                - Submit action is disabled
                - Input area is cleared but preserved in history
                - Escape key cancels current streaming response
                - Cancel adds "Request cancelled by user" message
                - Partial response is preserved in transcript

        Context: Streaming handling
            Status line shows token counts after response completes
            Partial responses are shown incrementally as received
            Response streaming can be cancelled by:
                - Escape key
                - Closing the conversation tab
                - Quitting the application

            Auto-scroll follows streamed content unless user scrolls up
            Unsaved partial responses are preserved in transcript on error

    Context: Conversations
        The top part of the conversation window will show a history of everything that has happened, including
        messages, responses from the application, and responses from the AI.  Historical messages cannot be edited

        Below the conversation history is a user input editor.  This input area will increase in size upwards as
        the user adds more content.  This editable region can be arbitrarily large.

        To the user, the historical details and the editable region must feel like they're one window.  Where they
        are required, there is only one vertical scroll bar to cover both the history and editable area.

        Context: Status bar
            The status bar at the bottom of each conversation window shows:

            - Current AI model name (e.g., "Model: gpt-4o-mini")
            - Temperature setting if applicable (e.g., "Temp: 0.7" or "Temp: N/A" for models without temperature)
            - Input and output token counts for the last message

            In parenthesis after the input token count should be the context window size.

        Context: Highlighting operations
            While the editable and non-editable regions must feel like they're one thing, if the user wants to
            interact with them they will behave differently.  For example, highlighting of text cannot span
            between the editable and non-editable regions.

        Context: Message display
            Messages must automatically adjust their display height based on content.  The height adjustment should
            happen smoothly and in real-time as content is added or removed.

        Context: Conversation Settings
            Each conversation can have its own AI model and temperature settings that affect how the AI responds.

            Context: Settings Dialog
                A "Settings" dialog can be accessed for each conversation via a menu or keyboard shortcut (see
                "Conversation Settings" menu item)

                The dialog shows the current settings for the active conversation tab.

                Context: AI Model
                    The AI model is selected via a dropdown menu.

                    Available models should be configurable at application startup.

                    Any change to the model selection takes effect on the next message sent to the AI.

                    If a model's provider is not available (no API key), that model should be disabled in the
                    conversation settings.

                Context: Temperature
                    The temperature is set via a numeric input field that:

                    - Accepts values between 0.0 and 1.0
                    - Shows one decimal place
                    - Has spinner arrows for adjustment
                    - Default value is 0.7
                    - Changes take effect on the next message sent to the AI

                Context: Model limits display
                    The dialog shows the model's limitations:

                    - Context window size (maximum input tokens)
                    - Maximum output tokens

                    These are displayed below the temperature setting.

                Context: Dialog Controls
                    The dialog has:

                    - "OK" button to save changes and close
                    - "Cancel" button to discard changes and close
                    - "Apply" button to save changes without closing

                    The dialog is modal, preventing interaction with the main window while open.

        Context: Input formatting
            The input box supports Markdown-style code formatting:

            Context: Code blocks
                Text between matching triple backticks (```) is displayed as a code block.
                Code blocks use a monospace font (set as a family fallback: Lucida Console, Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, Courier New, monospace).
                The background colour for code blocks is dark grey (#2d2d2d) and extends across the full width of the input box.
                The code block formatting applies to both the triple backtick lines and all content between them.

            Context: Inline code
                Text between single backticks (`) is displayed as inline code.
                Inline code uses the same monospace font as code blocks.
                Inline code has no background colour.

            Context: Formatting updates
                The formatting is updated in real-time as the user types.
                When inside a code block, each new line is automatically formatted with the monospace font and background.
                The full width background for code blocks is applied immediately, and not just when a newline is entered.

        Context: History display formatting
            The history display supports the same Markdown-style code formatting as the input box:

            Context: Code blocks
                Text between matching triple backticks (```) is displayed as a code block.
                Code blocks use the same monospace font as the input area (Lucida Console, Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, Courier New, monospace).
                The background colour for code blocks is dark grey (#2d2d2d) and extends across the full width.
                The code block formatting applies to both the triple backtick lines and all content between them.

            Context: Inline code
                Text between single backticks (`) is displayed as inline code.
                Inline code uses the same monospace font as code blocks.
                Inline code has no background colour.

            Context: Formatting interaction
                The Markdown formatting is applied in real-time as messages are added or updated.

    Context: Conversation transcript files
        The application will record a transcript of all conversations between the user and the AI, storing each turn
        in a JSON data structure.  The JSON data structure will be written to a transcript file called
        "yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-ttt.conv", substituting the conversation start date and time (in UTC) for yyyy,
        mm, dd, hh, mm, ss, ttt (year, numeric month, day-of-month, hours, minutes, seconds, and thousandths of
        seconds respectively).

        Transcript files will be written to a "conversations" directory of the current mindspace directory.  If this
        does not exist then the application should create it.

        On closing a conversation tab the matching file must be fully closed.

        Context: Transcript JSON schema
            Use the following JSON schema:

            ```json
            {
                "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",

                "required": ["metadata", "conversation"]
            }
            ```

        Context: Error recovery
            - Write to temp file first.
            - Atomic rename on successful write.
            - On write failure:
                1. Log error to stderr.
                2. Create backup file.
                3. Continue with new file.

    Context: AI interactions
        The AI backend supports streaming responses that arrive incrementally.  These should be displayed
        as they arrive with content continuing to be added as more arrives.

        AI responses my be either "reasoning" or "response".  Reasoning occurs where a model explicitly
        generates a series of responses to help it construct a response.

        Context: Streaming responses
            The backend provides chunks containing:

            - Content so far
            - Usage statistics (in final chunk only)

            Streaming requires that the display:

            - Shows content immediately as it arrives
            - Updates transcript periodically during streaming
            - Writes final response when stream completes
            - Updates token count after stream completes

            During streaming, if the user hits "Esc" then this will terminate the current streaming response and cancel
            any ongoing request with the AI.  A message "Request cancelled by user" will be added to the history.

        Context: UI handling of streaming
            The display must handle streaming responses by:

            - Tracking where the streamed response starts in history
            - Updating display incrementally as content arrives
            - Removing previous content before adding updates
            - Maintaining newline format and text wrapping

    Context: AI models
        A variety of AI models are available from different AI providers.

        Context: Model providers
            Models are provided by different AI services:

            - Anthropic models: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "claude-3.7-sonnet-20250219"
            - Deepseek models: "deepseek-chat", "deepseek-reasoner"
            - Google models: "gemini-1.5-flash", "gemini-1.5-pro", "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
            - M6R models: "tessa"
            - Ollama models: "llama3.2", "phi4"
            - OpenAI models: "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o", "o1-mini", "o1-preview"

            The AI model is configurable via the settings dialog.  If Google's model is available then we default
            to it, then to Anthropic, and finally OpenAI.

            For each provider, the default model is the first one in each list.

        Context: Provider configuration
            Each provider requires its own API key, as noted in the section about API key configuration.

            At least one provider must be configured for the application to start.

    Context: Temperature settings
        Temperature controls how deterministic or creative the AI's responses are:

        - claude-3-5-haiku-20241022: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - claude-3-7-sonnet-20240219: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - deepseek-chat: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - deepseek-reasoner: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - gemini-1.5-flash: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - gemini-1.5-pro: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - gemini-2.0-flash-exp: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - tessa: No temperature setting
        - llama3.2: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - phi4: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - gpt-4o-mini: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - gpt-4o: Supports temperature 0.0-1.0
        - o1-mini: No temperature setting
        - o1-preview: No temperature setting

        Where adjustable, the AI temperature for an AI model will be configurable via the settings dialog.

        The temperature control in the Settings dialog is automatically:

        - Enabled and set to 0.7 by default for models that support temperature.
        - Disabled for models that do not support a temperature setting.
        - Preserves previous temperature when switching between models that support temperatures.
        - Reverts to default when switching from models that do not support temperatures to a model that does.

    Context: Error handling and recovery
        Context: Handling other network errors
            If there are any API errors, such as invalid API keys then the application should report these to the user
            so they are aware these need to be corrected.

    Context: Error handling and recovery
        Context: Error Categories
            The application handles these error types:

            - Network: Connection, timeout, DNS failures
            - API: Authentication, rate limits, invalid requests
            - Application: Input validation, state corruption
            - System: File IO, memory, permissions

        Context: Network timeouts
            If the AI does not respond within 120 seconds of being sent a request, then the application should treat this as
            a timeout and retry up to 3 times.  Each time it retries, it should report that it is retrying.

        Context: Error response strategy
            For each error:

            - Log full details to transcript
            - Display user-friendly message as an application response.  For example:

                429: "Rate limit exceeded.  Retrying in [X] seconds..."
                500: "OpenAI service error.  Retrying in [X] seconds..."
                timeout: "Request timed out.  Retrying in [X] seconds..."

            - Implement appropriate recovery

            Recovery approach:

            - Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff.  Initial delay 2 seconds, doubling each retry.  Max 3 retries.
            - API errors: Handle rate limits, refresh credentials
            - Application errors: Reset to known good state
            - System errors: Graceful degradation

            During retries, preserve the message in the input box.

        Context: Provider-specific errors
            Each AI provider may return different error formats.  The application must normalize these different error formats
            into a consistent internal format for display and handling.

            Context: OpenAI errors
                OpenAI errors include:

                - Invalid API key
                - Rate limits exceeded
                - Model overloaded

            Context: Gemini errors
                Gemini errors include:

                - Invalid API key
                - Quota exceeded
                - Model not found
                - Invalid request format

        Context: Error display format
            Errors appear in message history with:

            - Severity indicator: [ERROR], [WARNING], [INFO]
            - Clear action message if user intervention needed

        Context: Recovery automation
            Context: Rate Limiting
                Track API calls with sliding 60-second window.

                Pause requests when approaching limits.

                If the user's request fails restore the failed message so they can try it again.

            Context: Retry strategy
                Maximum 3 retries for recoverable errors.

                Exponential backoff: 2, 4, 8 seconds.

                Preserve conversation context between retries.

    Context: Security
        Context: Outputs
            Ensure that no sensitive data is either logged or displayed on the screen.

            For example, API keys must never be revealled this way - replace with "[redacted API key]".

        Context: Inputs
            Ensure that all input control characters except for newlines are stripped from any input prior to processing.
